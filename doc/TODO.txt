To Do:

- clean up and add more unit tests
- allow for multiple pools
- make reconnection after a server failure an optional value
- back socket connection thread w/ a thread pool
- Try different compression streams as gzip stream is slow. (JNI??)
- Try to improve CRC32 hashing performance (java.zip.CRC32 is slooooow)
